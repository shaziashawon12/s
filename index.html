<p>A winter
<body>
  <div class="pera">
<h1>A winter morning</h1>
<p>
  A winter morning is very cold and foggy. There is dense fog everywhere in the morning. Dew drops fall 
  on the leaves and plants. The farmers go to work early in the morning, wearing warm clothes. Poor people suffer from the cold. They are seen burning fire to warm themselves. When the sun rises,
  people bask in the sun. In the winter mornings, people satisfy themselves by drinking tea and coffee.
  The beauty of winter mornings cannot be enjoyed in urban areas. If you want to see the winter morning from your heart, you have to go to the village.
  The cold and foggy weather will impress you there.When the sun slowly begins to peek out on a winter 
   bodies by burning straws. Poor people cannot afford to buy warm clothes. They are always waiting for the sunshine to protect them from the cold.Winter mornings are not pleasant for poor people. If we can arrange winter clothes for these 
   helpless people, winter mornings can be exciting mornings for everyone. In the winter mornings,
    I enjoy delicious and sweet Pithas, Cakes, Juice, etc.

     When the sun slowly begins to peek out on a winter morning, everyone starts to come out and sit in the sun. Many people try to warm their hands and bodies by burning straws. Poor people cannot afford to buy warm clothes. They are always waiting for the sunshine to protect them from the cold. Winter mornings are not pleasant for poor people.
